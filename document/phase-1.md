# Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis

## Project Title
**EventEase â€“ Smart Event & Venue Management CRM**

## Industry
Event Management & Hospitality

## Problem Statement
Event management companies face frequent challenges such as venue double-bookings, inefficient vendor assignments, delayed payment tracking, and complicated client coordination. These challenges lead to operational inefficiencies, revenue loss, and client dissatisfaction. EventEase aims to address these gaps by creating a Salesforce CRM platform that integrates venue management, vendor assignment, client invoicing, and payment processing with automation and role-based access controls.

## AppExchange Exploration & Justification

| App Name                    | Functionality                     | Limitation for EventEase           |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Event Management by CloudSherpas | Event scheduling and vendor management | Enterprise license cost, complexity |
| Payment Gateway Plugins      | Online payments integration       | Mostly paid, limited customizability  |
| Vendor Management Packages   | Vendor assignments and contracts  | Non-specific to event industry     |

**Justification:** No available apps fully cover EventEase requirements specific to event types, complex vendor relationships, and advanced payment workflows within Salesforce Developer Edition constraints. Custom CRM is necessary.
