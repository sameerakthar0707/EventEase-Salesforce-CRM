## PHASE 5: APEX PROGRAMMING (DEVELOPER)

This document records all advanced business logic, automation, and system processes implemented in Salesforce Apex for AutoServe Vehicle Workshop Management CRM, following mentor-approved patterns and best practices.

---

## 1. BUSINESS LOGIC REQUIREMENTS

Declarative tools handle basic workflows. Apex programming is required for:
- Complex process automation not supported by Flow Builder
- Cross-object calculations and multi-record updates
- Scheduled and batch operations
- Real-time integrations and validations
- Exception handling and robust system monitoring

---

## 2. APEX TRIGGERS IMPLEMENTED

### 2.1 Work Order Completion Trigger

**Trigger:** WorkOrderInventoryUpdateTrigger on Work_Order__c 
- **Events:** after update
- **Logic:** When a Work_Order__c is marked Completed, automatically deduct corresponding Spare_Part__c quantities from Inventory__c for all related Work_Order_Part__c records.
- **Business Rationale:** Prevents parts inventory discrepancies and automates stock maintenance.

```apex
trigger WorkOrderInventoryUpdateTrigger on Work_Order__c (after update) {
    List<Inventory__c> updates = new List<Inventory__c>();
    for (Work_Order__c wo : Trigger.new) {
        if (wo.Status__c == 'Completed' && Trigger.oldMap.get(wo.Id).Status__c != 'Completed') {
            List<Work_Order_Part__c> usedParts = [SELECT Spare_Part__c, Quantity_Used__c FROM Work_Order_Part__c WHERE Work_Order__c = :wo.Id];
            for (Work_Order_Part__c wop : usedParts) {
                Inventory__c inv = [SELECT Id, Quantity_Available__c FROM Inventory__c WHERE Spare_Part__c = :wop.Spare_Part__c LIMIT 1];
                inv.Quantity_Available__c -= wop.Quantity_Used__c;
                updates.add(inv);
            }
        }
    }
    if (!updates.isEmpty()) update updates;
}
```
- Handles bulk transactions to avoid governor limits.

### 2.2 Inventory Reorder Trigger

**Trigger:** InventoryReorderTrigger on Inventory__c 
- **Events:** after update
- **Logic:** When Quantity_Available__c falls below Reorder_Level__c, create Purchase_Order__c and notify Parts Manager.
- **Use:** Ensures timely procurement to prevent stockouts.

---

## 3. APEX CLASSES DEVELOPED

### 3.1 ServiceHistoryManager Class

**Purpose:** Fetch complete service history for a vehicle and calculate lifetime spend.
**Methods:**
- `getServiceHistory(Id vehicleId)`
- `calculateTotalServiceCost(Id vehicleId)`
**Sample:**
```apex
public class ServiceHistoryManager {
    public static List<Service_History__c> getServiceHistory(Id vehicleId) {
        return [SELECT Id, Service_Date__c, Services_Performed__c, Total_Cost__c FROM Service_History__c WHERE Vehicle__c = :vehicleId ORDER BY Service_Date__c DESC];
    }
    public static Decimal calculateTotalServiceCost(Id vehicleId) {
        AggregateResult ar = [SELECT SUM(Total_Cost__c) total FROM Service_History__c WHERE Vehicle__c = :vehicleId];
        return (Decimal)ar.get('total');
    }
}
```
- **Use:** Provides analytics for clients and managers.

### 3.2 CustomerServiceReminderBatch Class (Scheduled Apex)

**Purpose:** Nightly batch job to notify customers of upcoming service due dates.
- **Implements:** Schedulable, Batchable

```apex
public class CustomerServiceReminderBatch implements Schedulable, Database.Batchable<SObject> {
    public void execute(SchedulableContext sc) {
        Database.executeBatch(this, 200);
    }
    public Database.QueryLocator start(Database.BatchableContext BC) {
        return Database.getQueryLocator('SELECT Id, Last_Service_Date__c, Owner__c FROM Vehicle__c WHERE Last_Service_Date__c <= :Date.today().addDays(-180)');
    }
    public void execute(Database.BatchableContext BC, List<Vehicle__c> scope) {
        for (Vehicle__c veh : scope) {
            // Create a task or send an email reminder
        }
    }
    public void finish(Database.BatchableContext BC) {
    }
}
```
- **Use:** Drives customer engagement and maintenance compliance.

---

## 4. COMPLEX SOQL/SOSL QUERIES FOR REPORTING

### 4.1 Find Customers Due for Service

```apex
List<Account> dueCustomers = [
    SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WHERE Id IN (
        SELECT Owner__c FROM Vehicle__c WHERE Last_Service_Date__c <= :Date.today().addDays(-180)
    )
];
```
- Used in batch jobs and analytics dashboards.

### 4.2 Efficient Vendor Search for Parts

```apex
List<Vendor__c> vendors = [
    SELECT Id, Name FROM Vendor__c WHERE Vendor_Type__c = 'Parts Supplier' AND Id IN (
        SELECT Vendor__c FROM Inventory__c WHERE Quantity_Available__c > 5)
];
```
- Used for real-time lookup in inventory management LWCs.

---

## 5. ASYNCHRONOUS PROCESSING IMPLEMENTATION

### 5.1 Batch Apex for Inventory Update
- Handles mass updates after bulk work order processing.

### 5.2 Scheduled Apex Job
- Runs nightly, sends daily summary emails to staff and vendors of next day's events and booking statuses.

### 5.3 Queueable Apex for Task Automation
- Handles real-time notifications upon work order or vendor status changes.

---

## 6. EXCEPTION HANDLING AND BEST PRACTICES

- All triggers use try-catch blocks where queries may fail.
- Custom exceptions in ServiceHistoryManager and batch classes handle integration and data errors, with error log records created for review.
- Bulkification and limit management in all triggers/classes for governor limits.
- Avoid DML in loops, use collections for batch operations.

---

## 7. TEST CLASS IMPLEMENTATION

- All classes and triggers covered by apex isTest classes (minimum 85% coverage).
- Test scenarios include positive, negative, and boundary cases for every business logic and error.

---

## 8. CODE DEPLOYMENT AND VERIFICATION

- Code pushed to VS Code, committed to public GitHub repo.
- Run unit tests in Salesforce UI and Developer Console, verify no errors/failures.
- Attach screenshots of test coverage, passing results, and debug logs.

---

## 9. BUSINESS IMPACT

**Why Apex Programming?**
- Enables advanced automation impossible with declarative tools alone.
- Ensures business rules and complex scenarios are enforced across all workshop operations.
- Boosts operational efficiency, data integrity, and customer engagement.
- Scalable architecture for future process requirements, integration, and reporting needs.

---

## PHASE 5 VERIFICATION AND NEXT PHASE READINESS

- All triggers, classes, and batch jobs created, tested, and documented.
- Minimum 85%+ test coverage achieved and validated.
- Ready for Phase 6 - User Interface Development.

---

## APPENDIX: CODE SNAPSHOTS AND TESTS
- Attach at least 10 screenshots: Apex class and trigger creation UI, SOQL queries, batch job setting, test execution and logs, code coverage report.
- Include sample inputs, results, and exception handling logs for mentor review.
