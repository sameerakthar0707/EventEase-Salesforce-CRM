## 1. VALIDATION RULES IMPLEMENTED

**Purpose:** Ensure data integrity and enforce business rules across all AutoServe objects to maintain accurate workshop service data and prevent operational errors.

### 1.1 Vehicle Data Validation (Vehicle__c)

**A. VIN Number Format Validation**
- **Object:** Vehicle__c  
- **Rule Name:** Valid_VIN_Format  
- **Error Formula:** `LEN(Name) <> 17`  
- **Error Message:** "VIN number must be exactly 17 characters"  
- **Business Logic:** Prevents invalid VIN entries ensuring compliance with automotive standards  
- **Screenshot:** Navigation Setup → Object Manager → Vehicle → Validation Rules → New  
*Take screenshot showing validation rule configuration*

**B. Manufacturing Year Logic**
- **Rule Name:** Valid_Manufacturing_Year  
- **Error Formula:** `OR(Year__c < 1990, Year__c > YEAR(TODAY()) + 1)`  
- **Error Message:** "Manufacturing year must be between 1990 and next year"  
- **Business Logic:** Ensures realistic vehicle age for accurate service recommendations  

**C. Registration Number Required**
- **Rule Name:** Registration_Required_Active_Vehicle  
- **Error Formula:** `AND(Status__c = "Active", ISBLANK(Registration_Number__c))`  
- **Error Message:** "Registration number is required for active vehicles"  
- **Business Logic:** Ensures legal compliance for vehicles in service  

### 1.2 Work Order Business Logic (Work_Order__c)

**A. Service Date Validation**
- **Object:** Work_Order__c  
- **Rule Name:** Service_Date_Not_Past  
- **Error Formula:** `Scheduled_Date__c < NOW()`  
- **Error Message:** "Service appointment cannot be scheduled in the past"  
- **Business Logic:** Prevents scheduling errors and maintains appointment integrity  

**B. Completion Date Logic**
- **Rule Name:** Completion_After_Scheduled  
- **Error Formula:** `AND(NOT(ISBLANK(Completion_Date__c)), Completion_Date__c < Scheduled_Date__c)`  
- **Error Message:** "Work completion date cannot be before scheduled service date"  
- **Business Logic:** Ensures logical workflow timeline and accurate service tracking  

**C. Work Order Closure Requirements**
- **Rule Name:** Complete_Work_Order_Requirements  
- **Error Formula:** `AND(Status__c = "Completed", OR(ISBLANK(Work_Description__c), Total_Amount__c <= 0))`  
- **Error Message:** "Work description and total amount are required to complete work order"  
- **Business Logic:** Prevents incomplete service records and ensures billing accuracy  

### 1.3 Inventory Management Validation (Inventory__c)

**A. Positive Inventory Quantity**
- **Object:** Inventory__c  
- **Rule Name:** Positive_Inventory_Quantity  
- **Error Formula:** `Quantity_Available__c < 0`  
- **Error Message:** "Inventory quantity cannot be negative"  
- **Business Logic:** Maintains inventory accuracy and prevents overselling parts  

**B. Reorder Level Logic**
- **Rule Name:** Valid_Reorder_Level  
- **Error Formula:** `Reorder_Level__c > Quantity_Available__c * 2`  
- **Error Message:** "Reorder level cannot exceed twice the current quantity"  
- **Business Logic:** Prevents excessive inventory ordering and optimizes stock levels  

### 1.4 Spare Parts Usage Validation (Work_Order_Part__c)

**A. Positive Parts Usage**
- **Object:** Work_Order_Part__c  
- **Rule Name:** Positive_Parts_Quantity  
- **Error Formula:** `Quantity_Used__c <= 0`  
- **Error Message:** "Parts quantity used must be greater than zero"  
- **Business Logic:** Ensures accurate parts consumption tracking and cost calculation
