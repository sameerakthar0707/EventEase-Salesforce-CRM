## PHASE 8: DATA MANAGEMENT & DEPLOYMENT

This document details the data migration strategy, quality controls, backup processes, and deployment pipelines implemented for AutoServe Vehicle Workshop Management CRM according to mentor guidance.

## 1. DATA MIGRATION STRATEGY

### 1.1 Legacy Data Import Planning

**Objective:** Bulk import existing workshop data while ensuring integrity and continuity.

**Source Data:**
- Customers and Contacts (Excel/CSV)
- Vehicles and Service History (Legacy database exports)
- Work Orders (Manual records)
- Spare Parts and Inventory (ERP export)
- Vendors and Purchase Orders (Legacy systems)

**Tools & Methods:**
- **Data Loader:** For >50,000 records per object  
- **Data Import Wizard:** For up to 50,000 records, guided interface for Accounts, Contacts, and Custom Objects  
- **Mapping Templates:** Predefined CSV templates with API names (force-app/data/sample-*.csv)  

**Steps:**
1. Prepare and cleanse CSV files (remove duplicates, standardize formats)  
2. Import Accounts & Contacts via Data Import Wizard  
3. Load Vehicles & Service_History__c via Data Loader using External IDs  
4. Bulk import Work_Order__c and Work_Order_Part__c records  
5. Load Spare_Part__c and Inventory__c data  
6. Import Vendor__c and Purchase_Order__c entries

## 2. DATA QUALITY & DUPLICATE MANAGEMENT

### 2.1 Duplicate Rules and Matching Rules

**Navigation:** Setup → Duplicate Rules → New Duplicate Rule

| Object           | Matching Rule                             | Action                                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Account          | Match on Name + Phone                     | Alert and allow merge by system administrator                        |
| Contact          | Match on Email + Phone                    | Alert user with merge suggestion                                     |
| Vehicle__c       | Match on VIN + Registration Number        | Block creation of duplicates                                         |
| Spare_Part__c    | Match on Part_Number__c                   | Alert and auto-merge if identical                                    |

## 3. DATA BACKUP & RECOVERY

### 3.1 Backup Schedule

**Navigation:** Setup → Data Export → Schedule Export

- **Frequency:** Weekly full export (Sunday 2 AM IST)  
- **Objects Included:** All custom and critical standard objects  
- **Delivery:** Encrypted .zip files delivered via secure email or SFTP

### 3.2 Archive Strategy

- **Monthly Export:** Consolidated Excel workbooks with data snapshots  
- **Retention:** Keep 12 months of weekly backups and 5 years of monthly archives

## 4. DEPLOYMENT PIPELINE & TOOLS

### 4.1 Change Sets

**Usage:** Deploy metadata from Dev Sandbox to UAT and Production

**Components Included:**
- All custom objects, fields, and relationships  
- Validation rules, flows, and approval processes  
- Apex classes, triggers, and LWC bundles  
- Profiles, permission sets, and sharing settings  
- Email templates, reports, dashboards, and utility bar config

**Process:**
1. Create outbound change set in Dev Sandbox  
2. Upload to UAT, validate and run tests  
3. Promote to Production after UAT sign-off

### 4.2 Salesforce DX & CI/CD

**Framework:** SFDX with version control in Git

**Pipeline Steps:**
1. **Commit:** Developer pushes changes to GitHub main branch  
2. **Continuous Integration:** CI system runs `sfdx force:source:deploy` and unit tests  
3. **Static Code Analysis:** Lint Apex code and run PMD checks  
4. **Deploy to UAT:** Automated deploy on successful CI build  
5. **Automated Testing:** Run all Apex tests and Flow tests  
6. **Production Deploy:** Manual approval then deploy via CI

## 5. DATA IMPORT TEMPLATES & SAMPLE DATA

### 5.1 Sample CSV Files

**Location:** `/force-app/main/default/data/`

| File Name                | Description                         |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| sample-accounts.csv      | Customer and Contacts sample data   |
| sample-vehicles.csv      | Vehicle records sample              |

## 6. PRODUCTION DATA LOAD EXECUTION

**Pre-Deployment Steps:**
- Disable triggers and flows that may interfere with bulk import  
- Set all custom objects to allow only API access

2. Load Vehicles with External ID matching  
3. Load Service_History__c records  
4. Load Work_Order__c and Work_Order_Part__c  
5. Load Spare_Part__c and Inventory__c  
6. Load Vendor__c and purchase orders

**Post-Import Steps:**
- Re-enable triggers and flows  
- Run data consistency scripts and validation reports  
- Perform smoke tests on core functionalities
